When I was younger, MMOs were everywhere. World of Warcraft had already taken over the world with millions of players, Lineage II and Runescape had their own massive communities, and when AION launched in 2009 it quickly became one of the most talked-about MMOs around. 

But honestly the 10 years-old me never really got into it. My thing was mainly FPS. I’d rather be playing Halo 3 or Call of Duty matches than grinding dungeons and raids.

Few weeks ago tho, some of my friends decided to give AION another go, this time on a private server. 
For anyone unfamiliar, private servers are unofficial versions of a game run by the community. They invited me to join them, and that’s how I finally ended up in AION. Except, instead of just playing, I got curious about how things worked behind the scenes, which eventually led me to uncover a vulnerability hidden in the original client itself.
