My name is Francesco Giordano, and I’m a Product Security Engineer with a background in vulnerability research, malware development, and offensive security. 

I’m passionate about understanding how systems really work and how to break them.

Over the years, I’ve worked on projects involving exploit development, and internal security tooling for large-scale environments.

I’m also a developer at heart. I enjoy creating my own frameworks, automation tools, and research utilities to make security work faster and scaling better. You can find some of my projects and open-source contributions on [my GitHub](https://github.com/himazawa).

Before this blog, I used to run another blog at [bsod.dev](https://bsod.dev) but all the content is (slowly) getting moved here.

Outside of work, I like experimenting with web applications, embedded devices, and novel attack surfaces.

If you’d like to connect, collaborate or discuss security research, feel free to reach out. 
I’m always open to chatting about offensive security or interesting technical challenges. You can contact me at himazawa[at]this.domain
