<p>I&rsquo;ve witnessed organizations perform a never-ending clown show in the name of security.
This is commonly referred to as &ldquo;security theatre&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-security-theatre">What is the Security Theatre</h2>
<p>Security theatre, in its simplest form, is a grand illusion. It&rsquo;s security measures put in place not because they actually prevent security breaches, but because they look good on paper, pacify stakeholders, and make everyone feel like they&rsquo;re doing something to protect themselves.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRp7tYWnJJs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Oh, how I love the smell of compliance in the morning</a>.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, the requirement of having complex passwords that are regularly changed. This, is a classic example of security theatre.</p>
<p>While this may seem like a good idea on the surface, it actually does little to prevent security breaches. And let&rsquo;s not forget the inevitable result: password fatigue, causing employees to use ones that are easier to remember or simple variations of the one they previously used. There is a reason (multiple, actually) if <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/expansion-of-fido-standard-and-new-updates-for-microsoft/ba-p/3290633" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/one-step-closer-to-a-passwordless-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Google</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/05/apple-google-and-microsoft-commit-to-expanded-support-for-fido-standard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Apple</a> want to move away from passwords.</p>

<p>Another example of security theatre is implementing security controls that are not properly configured or maintained. For instance, firewalls, IDS and IPS are a common security measure that are often poorly configured or not kept up-to-date with the latest security patches</p>
<h2 id="root-cause">Root cause</h2>
<p>So, what can organizations do to avoid this never-ending circus? First and foremost, they need to understand the real threats they face and implement controls that address those specific threats. This must include in fist place educating employees on how to recognize and respond to attacks.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity after all, is the Gold Rush 2.0, lots of money are on the table and everyone wants to join, so finding skilled individuals is hard and if you hire consultants is even worse because you will fully depend on them for your security posture.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>
<p>In conclusion, security theatre, is a common problem in the IT security world. To avoid being part of the show, organizations must focus on implementing effective controls, regularly assessing their effectiveness, and having a comprehensive response plan in place. And, for the love of god, stop with the pointless policies already!</p>

Lot of stuff happen since the last post in 2018 on <a href="https://bsod.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">the old blog</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I wasn&rsquo;t able to write much, both for the lack of time and the impossibility to share what I learned.
This post contains an introduction to this new website and how it will work from now on.</p>
<p>First of all, I&rsquo;m still in Security but moved to Product Security (more on this on a later post but TL;DR: boredom, careeer and growth opportunities, frustration and fear of burnout).
Fortunately I still have time and resources on my job to conduct vulnerability research so occasionally I will post about interesting vulnerabilities I found.
I would also like to talk about security aspects more related to SDLC, so let&rsquo;s see how it&rsquo;ll go.</p>
<h2 id="how-this-blog-works">How this blog works</h2>
<p>The setup is pretty simple, I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">hugo</a> to build static pages and publish them on GitHub pages. There is a <a href="https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-hugo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Github Action</a> running that builds and deploy the pages every time a PR is approved on the <code>main</code> branch.
<figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/posts/long-time-no-see/blog_CI_CD.png" title="/posts/long-time-no-see/blog_CI_CD.png" data-thumbnail="/posts/long-time-no-see/blog_CI_CD.png" data-sub-html="<h2>A graph represeting the logic flow behind the blog deployment system</h2>">
        
    </a><figcaption class="image-caption">A graph represeting the logic flow behind the blog deployment system</figcaption>
    </figure></p>
<p>The theme used is <a href="https://hugoloveit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">LoveIt</a>, it&rsquo;s pretty cool and rich of features but has few bugs that need to be fixed; for example, if you are using the blog in Italian you can see that the localization is pretty much fucked up.
The theme localization it&rsquo;s a pretty cool feature but having to rewrite the same post for each language is painful, so I&rsquo;m thinking about adding the support to DeepL.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the blog got a new logo:
<figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/images/logo.png" title="/images/logo.png" data-thumbnail="/images/logo.png" data-sub-html="<h2>appsec.space logo</h2>">
        
    </a><figcaption class="image-caption">appsec.space logo</figcaption>
    </figure></p>
<p>it was generated by <a href="https://midjourney.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Midjourney</a> and means absolutely nothing!</p>
<h2 id="the-future">The future</h2>
<p>What&rsquo;s next, you ask? Well.. a lot of stuff actually. First of all I need to migrate all the posts from the old blog because I would like to retain an archive. Next I can start writing new posts.</p>
<div class="details admonition note open">
        <div class="details-summary admonition-title">
            <i class="icon fas fa-pencil-alt fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>Note<i class="details-icon fas fa-angle-right fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="details-content">
            <div class="admonition-content">If you get a redirect from the old blog to the new one the process has been completed.</div>
        </div>
    </div>
<p>Despite being called <code>appsec.space</code> I would like to talk about different topics, spacing from Application Security to Malware Developmemnt (for learning purposes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmZm8vNHBSU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">of course</a>), to productivity setup and generic rants, basically turning this blog into my stream of counciousness.</p>
<p>The next post will probably talk about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_theater" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Security Theater</a>.</p>
<p>See you then!</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
