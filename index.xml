            </div><p>As you probably already heard, the <code>xz</code> package got compromised.</p>
<p>The package was used as entrypoint to inject malicious code in sshd, altering the authentication flow. This forged vulnerability is now known as CVE-2024-3094.</p>

<p>This is probably a full fledge operation due to it&rsquo;s methodology and duration but I&rsquo;m not the right guy to talk about OpSec and Threat Actors attributions.
As soon as I will find a complete analysis on that matter I will link it.</p>
<p>The situation doesn&rsquo;t look too good so I&rsquo;m trying to write this blogpost as a summary. I don&rsquo;t want to address the technical aspect of the compromission but I want to look at the issue from the perspective of a Security Engineer, summarizing what went wrong and trying to find a remediation.</p>

<li><strong>Apr 2022</strong>:
<ul>
<li>A new maintainer shows up in the <code>xz</code> project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>29 Mar 2024</strong>:
<ul>
<li>
<p>Andres Freund sent an email to the oss-security security regarding a backdoor in <code>xz/liblzma</code>.
He was optimizing his infrastructure and found that ssh was  suspiciously slow. Some debug later he found the issue was likely caused by the backdoor. The initial analysis was performed with the help of Florian Weimer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The post was sent to the oss-security mailing list</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impacted distros are starting to ship patches to downgrade the xz version (more on that later)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>30 Mar 2024</strong>:
<ul>
<li>GitHub blocked access to the repostiory and blocked the account of both the xz maintainers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impacted-components" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#impacted-components" class="header-mark"></a>2 Impacted components</h2><p>The extent of this breach is still unkown, but here is a (partial) list of components shipping the known malicious version of <code>xz</code>:</p>
<p>Distributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arch</li>
<li>Gentoo</li>
<li>Manjaro Testing</li>
<li>Parabola</li>
<li>NixOS Unstable</li>
<li>Slackware</li>
<li>SUSE Thumbleweed</li>
<li>Kali Linux</li>
</ul>
<p>The backdoored package is also contained in the following package managers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Homebrew</li>
<li>MacPorts</li>
<li>pkgsrc</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="considerations" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#considerations" class="header-mark"></a>3 Considerations</h2><h3 id="the-github-behavior" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#the-github-behavior" class="header-mark"></a>3.1 The GitHub Behavior</h3><p>The reasons behind the <code>xz</code> repositories are still a mistery to me, especially knowing that with the source code available additional anaysis on the backdoor could be performed.</p>
<p>Blocking access to the source code is something that will delay further results, that is honestly really bad for time-critical situation like this one.</p>
<h3 id="the-downgrades" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#the-downgrades" class="header-mark"></a>3.2 The downgrades</h3><p>The patch strategy for basically everyone was to force a downgrade from the <code>5.6.0</code>-<code>5.6.1</code> to another version.<br>
Some (homebrew, for exaple), forced the downgrade to 5.4.6.</p>
<p>This looks interesting because for sure we know there is a backdoor on that (<code>5.6.0</code>-<code>5.6.1</code>) versions, but we also know that the attacker has been working on the repository for over two years.</p>
<p>The <code>5.4.6</code> version is also builded by the attacker and honestly wouldn&rsquo;t trust it much.
Again, thanks GitHub for locking the access to the source code.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-prevent-this-issue" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#how-to-prevent-this-issue" class="header-mark"></a>4 How to prevent this issue?</h2><p>As I said at the beginning of the post, I don&rsquo;t want to go too deep into the technical analysis of the backdoor, for two main reasons: with the sourcecode locked and only <a href="https://github.com/xz-mirror/xz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an archive available</a> the informations are incomplete and I really don&rsquo;t want to reverse the <code>xz</code> binary.
Also, and this is the more important reasons, people more knoledgeble than me on Threat Actors behaviors are already on it.
I will just link their posts once are ready, so make sure to check the Resource below.</p>
<p>One thing I can do here is showing the point of view of a Security Engineer on the issue, how I would mitigate the problem and what steps went wrong.</p>

<p><code>xz</code> is a software mainteined (up until 2022) by 1 single guy. Later another maintainer joined but unfortunately for us, it was the same guy pushing the backdoor to upstream.
This crashes against the fact that <code>xz</code> is an incredibly popular package available in a lot of distributions and being a dependency of many softwares.</p>
<p>This was likely seen by the attacker as a gold mine since it was easy to get the role of maintainer of the project and push the malicious code.</p>
<p>Since you are using a thirdy-part source for your supply chain, you have to trust someone at one point or another.
When talking about supply chain security the reccomendations are always the same: pin the hashes and use signature verification. This will work as long as you have scenarios like a  malicious attacker compromising the dependency CICD and pushing a malicious build, account compromissions etc.</p>
<p>But what can you do if all of a sudden, trusted maintainer goes rogue?</p>
<p>As a standard user, unless you want (and are able to) code review every single commit from every single piece of software your OS interact with: pretty much nothing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, developers and repository owners should really increase controls on their supply chain and include strict metrics to exclude high risk packages.
One of the biggest gimmicks of Open Source security is people beliving that since the source code is available the code magically became safe.</p>
<p>One critical factor often overlooked is the assumption that having access to the source code automatically translates into a larger pool of eyes scrutinizing it for vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of this review process depends on the level of community engagement and the expertise of those inspecting the code, and usually is not much at all. Many projects receive minimal attention from developers, with only a handful of individuals actively contributing or reviewing code changes. As a result, vulnerabilities (intentional or not) may go unnoticed for extended periods, posing significant security risks to users.</p>
<p>Every time a discussion like that appears I always remember the <a href="https://blog.infosectcbr.com.au/2018/11/pitfalls-using-strcat.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InfosectCBR&rsquo;s &ldquo;Month of Kali&rdquo;</a> where <a href="https://twitter.com/silviocesare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silvio Cesare</a> spent a month popping vulnerabilities on Kali Linux software.</p>
<p>But which factors could contribute on minimizing the risks?</p>
<h3 id="github-stats" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#github-stats" class="header-mark"></a>4.2 GitHub Stats</h3><p>Just to be clear from the beginning: No, you can&rsquo;t trust this kind of metrics.</p>
<p>There is an hidden market of buying and selling GitHub stats like stars, forks etc.
You can read a nice article here: <a href="https://dagster.io/blog/fake-stars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://dagster.io/blog/fake-stars</a></p>
<h3 id="community-engagement" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#community-engagement" class="header-mark"></a>4.3 Community Engagement</h3><p>Evaluate the size and engagement of the community surrounding the project.</p>
<p>A large and active community can provide additional eyes for reviewing code, reporting bugs, and addressing security issues promptly. <code>xz/liblzma</code> had litterally 2 maintainers and one was the malicious actor.</p>
<h3 id="funding-and-support" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#funding-and-support" class="header-mark"></a>4.4 Funding and Support</h3><p>Consider whether the project receives financial support or sponsorship from reputable organizations. Projects with dedicated funding tend to have more resources available for security audits and ongoing maintenance.
And also are less likely to be completely abandoned.</p>

<h3 id="sdlc" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#sdlc" class="header-mark"></a>4.5 SDLC</h3><p>A good portion of the evaluation should also focus on the SDLC to e ensure security (and quality in general) gates are correcly implemented, approvals on PRs are mandatory and there are healthy practices in place to prevent one single contributor to push malicious code without approval.</p>
<p>Also take in considerations that we are humans, and we make errors. Passing a code review doesn&rsquo;t mean the code is safe, as I said before: there is no real solution, just ways to decrease the probablity for the bad stuff to happen.</p>
<h3 id="enterprise-vs-individual" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#enterprise-vs-individual" class="header-mark"></a>4.6 Enterprise vs Individual</h3><p>This is a controversial topic because there are projects that are maintained by individuals that are well maintained but usually relying on (large) enterprise projects will ensure their SDLC best practices are followed, money are keeping the project alive, and a big company is less likely to go all in and backdoor their project on purpose. Again, this just increase the probablity, don&rsquo;t take for granted ;)</p>

More like Security Circus</title><link>https://appsec.space/posts/security-theatre/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2023 20:20:00 +0100</pubDate><author><name>himazawa</name></author><guid>https://appsec.space/posts/security-theatre/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/posts/security-theatre/cargocult.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>I have seen many companies invest significant time and resources into security measures that have little to no actual effect on security. This is commonly referred to as &ldquo;security theater&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-security-theatre" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#what-is-the-security-theatre" class="header-mark"></a>1 What is the Security Theatre</h2><p>Security theater refers to the practice of implementing security measures for the sake of appearances, without any significant impact on actual security. These measures may give the illusion of protection, but in reality, they provide little to no real security benefits.</p>
<p>Organizations often fall into the trap of focusing solely on compliance requirements without considering their actual security needs. Compliance-driven security measures may give the illusion of being protected, but they often fail to address the specific security risks faced by an organization.</p>
<p>Useless compliance can also result in organizations wasting valuable resources on implementing measures that do not have a significant impact on their security posture. This can lead to a situation where an organization is in compliance with regulations, but the security budget is depleted, while their assets are still vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRp7tYWnJJs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oh, how I love the smell of compliance in the morning</a>.</p>
<p>An example of Security Theatre is the use of complex passwords that are changed regularly. Although it may seem like a good idea, it can lead to password fatigue and employees using easier-to-remember passwords, which actually undermines security. This is among the reasons why companies like <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/expansion-of-fido-standard-and-new-updates-for-microsoft/ba-p/3290633" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/05/apple-google-and-microsoft-commit-to-expanded-support-for-fido-standard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple</a>, and <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/one-step-closer-to-a-passwordless-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google</a> are moving away from passwords.</p>
<figure><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png"><figcaption>
      <h4>fix your password policy</h4>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another example of security theatre is implementing security controls that are not properly configured or maintained. For instance, firewalls, IDS and IPS are a common security measure that are often poorly configured or not kept up-to-date with the latest security patches</p>
<h2 id="root-cause" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#root-cause" class="header-mark"></a>2 Root cause</h2><p>Cybersecurity has become the new gold rush, with numerous individuals and organizations seeking to take advantage of the potential financial gains. However, finding skilled personnel to address these security concerns can be challenging, and relying on consultants can lead to a situation where the organization becomes overly dependent on their expertise.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#wrapping-up" class="header-mark"></a>3 Wrapping up</h2><p>Organizations can protect themselves from the constant security threats by taking a proactive approach. The first step is to gain a thorough understanding of the specific risks they are facing and then implement the necessary measures to mitigate these risks. This includes educating their employees to be aware of potential attacks and how to respond in such situations.</p>
<p>In conclusion, to avoid being caught in the trap of &ldquo;security theater&rdquo;, organizations must concentrate on establishing practical security measures and regularly evaluate their effectiveness. Having a well-thought-out response plan in place is also critical in ensuring the protection of the organization&rsquo;s assets.</p>
<p>Additionally, organizations should cease creating redundant policies that serve no purpose in enhancing the organization&rsquo;s overall security posture.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I wasn&rsquo;t able to write much, both for the lack of time and the impossibility to share what I learned.
This post contains an introduction to this new website and how it will work from now on.</p>
<p>First of all, I&rsquo;m still in Security but moved to Product Security (more on this on a later post but TL;DR: boredom, careeer and growth opportunities, frustration and fear of burnout).
Fortunately I still have time and resources on my job to conduct vulnerability research so occasionally I will post about interesting vulnerabilities I found.
I would also like to talk about security aspects more related to SDLC, so let&rsquo;s see how it&rsquo;ll go.</p>
<h2 id="how-this-blog-works" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#how-this-blog-works" class="header-mark"></a>1 How this blog works</h2><p>The setup is pretty simple, I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hugo</a> to build static pages and publish them on GitHub pages. There is a <a href="https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-hugo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github Action</a> running that builds and deploy the pages every time a PR is approved on the <code>main</code> branch.

    </a><figcaption class="image-caption">A graph represeting the logic flow behind the blog deployment system</figcaption>
    </figure></p>
<p>The theme used is <a href="https://hugoloveit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LoveIt</a>, it&rsquo;s pretty cool and rich of features but has few bugs that need to be fixed; for example, if you are using the blog in Italian you can see that the localization is pretty much fucked up.
The theme localization it&rsquo;s a pretty cool feature but having to rewrite the same post for each language is painful, so I&rsquo;m thinking about adding the support to DeepL.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the blog got a new logo:
<figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/images/logo.png" title="/images/logo.png" data-thumbnail="/images/logo.png" data-sub-html="<h2>appsec.space logo</h2>">
        <img

<h2 id="the-future" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#the-future" class="header-mark"></a>2 The future</h2><p>What&rsquo;s next, you ask? Well.. a lot of stuff actually. First of all I need to migrate all the posts from the old blog because I would like to retain an archive. Next I can start writing new posts.</p>

<h2 id="the-skills-system" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#the-skills-system" class="header-mark"></a>3 The skills system</h2><p>Digging deeper we can see that Mycroft has a skills system and a default skill that can install others skills (pretty neat, right?)</p>
<p>How is a skill composed? From what we can see from the documentation a default skill is composed by:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>dialog/en-us/command.dialog</code> contains the vocal command that will trigger the skill</li>
<li><code>vocab/en-us/answer.voc</code> contains the answer that Mycroft will pronounce</li>
<li><code>requirements.txt</code> contains the requirements for the skill that will be installed with <code>pip</code></li>
<li><code>__int__.py</code> contains the main function of the skill and will be loaded when the skill is triggered</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-can-i-do-now" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#what-can-i-do-now" class="header-mark"></a>4 What can I do now?</h2><p>I could create a malicious skill that when triggered runs arbitrary code on the remote machine, but unfortunately this is not possible via vocal command unless the URL of the skill is not whitelisted via the online website. So this is possible but will be a little tricky.</p>
<h3 id="so-im-done" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#so-im-done" class="header-mark"></a>4.1 So I&rsquo;m done?</h3><p>Not yet. I found out that I can trigger skills remotely and that is possible to execute commands on a remote machine convincing the user to install a malicious skill. I may have enough to submit a vulnerability report. But maybe I can do a bit better&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="getting-a-remote-shell-using-default-skills" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#getting-a-remote-shell-using-default-skills" class="header-mark"></a>5 Getting a remote shell using default skills</h2><p>We know that Mycroft has some <a href="https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-skills" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">default skills</a> like <code>open</code> that will open an application and others that are whitelisted but not installed. Reading through to the list, I found a really interesting skill called <code>skill-autogui</code>, whose description says <code>Manipulate your mouse and keyboard with Mycroft</code>. <strong>We got it!</strong></p>
