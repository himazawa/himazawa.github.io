# About Me


My name is Francesco Giordano and I'm a Product Security Engineer with a background in vulnerability reasearch, malware development and offensive security in general.

I also like to develop my own frameworks and tools, you can find my work and contributions on [my GitHub](https://github.com/himazawa).

I used to run [another blog](https://bsod.dev), you can read more about that [here](/posts/long-time-no-see)
