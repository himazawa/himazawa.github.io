            </div><p>Long time no see, uh? Lot of stuff happen since the last post in 2018 on <a href="https://bsod.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the old blog</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I wasn&rsquo;t able to write much, both for the lack of time and the impossibility to share what I learned.
This post contains an introduction to this new website and how it will work from now on.</p>
<p>First of all, I&rsquo;m still in Security but moved to Product Security (more on this on a later post but TL;DR: boredom, careeer and growth opportunities, frustration and fear of burnout).
Fortunately I still have time and resources on my job to conduct vulnerability research so occasionally I will post about interesting vulnerabilities I found.
I would also like to talk about security aspects more related to SDLC, so let&rsquo;s see how it&rsquo;ll go.</p>
<h2 id="how-this-blog-works" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#how-this-blog-works" class="header-mark" aria-label="Header mark for 'How this blog works'"></a>1 How this blog works</h2><p>The setup is pretty simple, I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hugo</a> to build static pages and publish them on GitHub pages. There is a <a href="https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-hugo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github Action</a> running that builds and deploy the pages every time a PR is approved on the <code>main</code> branch.

</figure></p>
<p>The theme used is <a href="https://hugoloveit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LoveIt</a>, it&rsquo;s pretty cool and rich of features but has few bugs that need to be fixed; for example, if you are using the blog in Italian you can see that the localization is pretty much fucked up.
The theme localization it&rsquo;s a pretty cool feature but having to rewrite the same post for each language is painful, so I&rsquo;m thinking about adding the support to DeepL.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the blog got a new logo:
<figure><img  loading="lazy" src="/images/logo.png"     ><figcaption class="image-caption">appsec.space logo</figcaption>
</figure></p>
<p>it was generated by <a href="https://midjourney.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Midjourney</a> and means absolutely nothing!</p>
<h2 id="the-future" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#the-future" class="header-mark" aria-label="Header mark for 'The future'"></a>2 The future</h2><p>What&rsquo;s next, you ask? Well.. a lot of stuff actually. First of all I need to migrate all the posts from the old blog because I would like to retain an archive. Next I can start writing new posts.</p>

<p>Despite being called <code>appsec.space</code> I would like to talk about different topics, spacing from Application Security to Malware Developmemnt (for learning purposes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmZm8vNHBSU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">of course</a>), to productivity setup and generic rants, basically turning this blog into my stream of counciousness.</p>
<p>The next post will probably talk about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_theater" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Security Theater</a>.</p>
<p>See you then!</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
