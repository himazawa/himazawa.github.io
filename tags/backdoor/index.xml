<p>The package was used as entrypoint to inject malicious code in sshd, altering the authentication flow. This forged vulnerability is now known as <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3094" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVE-2024-3094</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2023</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new maintainer shows up in the <code>xz</code> project</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>29 Mar 2024</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Andres Freund sent an email to the oss-security mailing list regarding a backdoor in <code>xz/liblzma</code>.
He was optimizing his infrastructure and found that ssh was  suspiciously slow. Some debug later he found the issue was likely caused by the backdoor. The initial analysis was performed with the help of Florian Weimer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impacted distros are starting to ship patches to downgrade the xz version (more on that later)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>30 Mar 2024</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>GitHub blocked access to the repostiory and blocked the account of both the xz maintainers, an updated code is available <a href="https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git;a=summary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An <a href="https://tukaani.org/xz-backdoor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official statement</a> was released by the project maintainer</p>

<p>The backdoored package is also contained in the repositories of the following package managers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Homebrew</li>
<li>MacPorts</li>
<li>pkgsrc</li>
</ul>
<p>At the moment we know that there are checks in the backdoor to <a href="https://gist.github.com/thesamesam/223949d5a074ebc3dce9ee78baad9e27#design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">target Linux instances and only x86_64/amd64</a> builds so the real number could be downsized, but since the entire situation is unclear I would not reccommend to keep a compromised package on your system.</p>
<h2 id="considerations" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#considerations" class="header-mark" aria-label="Header mark for 'Considerations'"></a>3 Considerations</h2><h3 id="the-github-behavior" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#the-github-behavior" class="header-mark" aria-label="Header mark for 'The GitHub Behavior'"></a>3.1 The GitHub Behavior</h3><p>The reasons behind the <code>xz</code> repositories lockdown are still a mistery to me, especially knowing that with the source code available additional anaysis on the backdoor could be performed.</p>
<p>Blocking access to the source code is something that will delay further results, that is honestly really bad for time-critical situation like this one. An updated mirror is available <a href="https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git;a=summary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></p>
<h3 id="the-downgrades" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#the-downgrades" class="header-mark" aria-label="Header mark for 'The downgrades'"></a>3.2 The downgrades</h3><p>The patch strategy for basically everyone was to force a downgrade from the <code>5.6.0</code>-<code>5.6.1</code> to another version.<br>
Some (homebrew, for example), forced the downgrade to 5.4.6.</p>
<p>This looks interesting because for sure we know there is a backdoor on that (<code>5.6.0</code>-<code>5.6.1</code>) versions, but we also know that the attacker has been working on the repository for over two years.</p>
<p>The <code>5.4.6</code> version is also builded by the attacker and honestly wouldn&rsquo;t trust it much.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-prevent-this-issue" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#how-to-prevent-this-issue" class="header-mark" aria-label="Header mark for 'How to prevent this issue?'"></a>4 How to prevent this issue?</h2><p>As I said at the beginning of the post, I don&rsquo;t want to go too deep into the technical analysis of the backdoor, for two main reasons: with the sourcecode locked and only <a href="https://github.com/xz-mirror/xz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an archive available</a> the informations are incomplete and I really don&rsquo;t want to reverse the <code>xz</code> binary.
Also, and this is the more important reasons, people more knowledgeable than me on Threat Actors behaviors are already on it.
I will just link their posts once are ready, so make sure to check the Resources section below.</p>
<p>One thing I can do here is showing the point of view of a Security Engineer on the issue, how I would mitigate the problem and what steps went wrong.</p>

    <a href="#trust-issues" class="header-mark" aria-label="Header mark for 'Trust issues'"></a>4.1 Trust issues</h3><p><img class="tw-inline" loading="lazy" src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/dependency_2x.png"     ></p>
<p><code>xz</code> is a software mainteined (up until 2023) by 1 single guy. Later another maintainer joined but unfortunately for us, it was the same guy pushing the backdoor to upstream.
This crashes against the fact that <code>xz</code> is an incredibly popular package available in a lot of distributions and being a dependency of many softwares.</p>
<p>This was likely seen by the attacker as a gold mine since it was easy to get the role of maintainer of the project and push the malicious code.</p>
<p>Since you are using a thirdy-part source for your supply chain, you have to trust someone at one point or another.
When talking about supply chain security the reccomendations are always the same: pin the hashes and use signature verification. This will work as long as you have scenarios like a malicious attacker compromising the dependency CICD and pushing a malicious build, account compromissions etc.</p>
<p>But what can you do if all of a sudden, trusted maintainers goes rogue?</p>
<p>As a standard user, unless you want (and are able to) code review every single commit from every single piece of software your OS interact with: pretty much nothing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, developers and repository owners should really increase controls on their supply chain and include strict metrics to exclude high risk packages.
One of the biggest gimmicks of Open Source security is people beliving that since the source code is available the code magically became safe.</p>
<p>One critical factor often overlooked is the assumption that having access to the source code automatically translates into a larger pool of eyes scrutinizing it for vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of this review process depends on the level of community engagement and the expertise of those inspecting the code, and usually is not much at all. Many projects receive minimal attention from developers, with only a handful of individuals actively contributing or reviewing code changes. As a result, vulnerabilities (intentional or not) may go unnoticed for extended periods, posing significant security risks to users.</p>
<p>Every time a discussion like that appears I always remember the <a href="https://blog.infosectcbr.com.au/2018/11/pitfalls-using-strcat.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InfosectCBR&rsquo;s &ldquo;Month of Kali&rdquo;</a> where <a href="https://twitter.com/silviocesare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silvio Cesare</a> spent a month popping vulnerabilities on Kali Linux software.</p>
<p>But which factors could contribute on minimizing the risks?</p>
<h3 id="github-stats" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#github-stats" class="header-mark" aria-label="Header mark for 'GitHub Stats'"></a>4.2 GitHub Stats</h3><p>Just to be clear from the beginning: No, you can&rsquo;t trust this kind of metrics.</p>
<p>There is an hidden market of buying and selling GitHub stats like stars, forks etc.
You can read a nice article here: <a href="https://dagster.io/blog/fake-stars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://dagster.io/blog/fake-stars</a></p>
<h3 id="community-engagement" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#community-engagement" class="header-mark" aria-label="Header mark for 'Community Engagement'"></a>4.3 Community Engagement</h3><p>Evaluate the size and engagement of the community surrounding the project.</p>
<p>A large and active community can provide additional eyes for reviewing code, reporting bugs, and addressing security issues promptly. <code>xz/liblzma</code> had litterally 2 maintainers and one was the malicious actor.</p>
<h3 id="funding-and-support" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#funding-and-support" class="header-mark" aria-label="Header mark for 'Funding and Support'"></a>4.4 Funding and Support</h3><p>Consider whether the project receives financial support or sponsorship from reputable organizations. Projects with dedicated funding tend to have more resources available for security audits and ongoing maintenance.
And also are less likely to be completely abandoned.</p>
